# HW-4
My name is Birhanu Mengistu and Here is a quiz of random questions basically general knowledge that is fun to play!
How it works is the user presses the start button and will be asked a serious of questions and get the results right away if whether they were right or wrong if they get the timer wrong it will deduct 15 sec from the timer hence the timer runs out the game will end.
I used my javascript, html and css tools and knowledge and applied it to my best knowledge.
what i did was use psuedocoding to construct my ideas together and laid it all out.
